入侵检测作业用。

Detection Requirement

• Detect http scan based on 404 response

• The attacker scan the website to look for vulnerabilities

• In the scanning process, a lot of 404 response will be

generated because the attacker has no knowledge of

the target site before scanning

• So we can detect the attacker through the 404 response

• But there are other scenarios will generate the 404

response,too.

• site configuration error, user mistype;

• the spiders repeat crawling the pages not existed

• downloading tools repeat download the failing url.

• The Algorithm Requirement

• make 404 statistics on orig_h

• In every 10 minutes

• if the count of 404 response > 2

• and if the 404 ratio > 20% (404 ratio = 404 response/all response)

• and if (the unique count of url response 404 / if the count of 404 response ) > 0.5

• then output ”x.x.x.x is a scanner with y scan attemps on z urls” where

• x.x.x.x is the orig_h, y is the count of 404 response , z is the unique count of url response 404

•You Need

• Sumstats is option but not a requirement

• you may use set, table and record to do the calculating

• you may measure the time interval every time http_reply is triggered
